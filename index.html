      <h3 style="padding-top: 20px;">History & Recent Success</h3>
      <p style = "padding-top: 50px;">The Indiana Pacers, established in 1967 as part of the American Basketball Association (ABA), are known for their strong basketball tradition. They joined the NBA in 1976 following the ABA-NBA merger. The team history is highlighted by three ABA championships (1970, 1972, 1973) and an NBA Finals appearance in 2000. Legendary players like Reggie Miller, one of the greatest three-point shooters of all time, and Paul George, who led them to the Conference Finals vs. LeBron James, define their legacy.</p>

        <p style = "padding-top: 50px;">The past decade the Pacers have had trouble finding success, but in recent seasons, the Pacers have been competitive again in the Eastern Conference. Last year, they reached the Eastern Conference Finals but were swept by the Boston Celtics, who went on to win the championship. The outlook following last season was positive, but their 2024-25 season has been challenging so far, with an 8-10 record, placing them 7th in the East. Injuries to players like Isaiah Jackson and James Wiseman have impacted the team, but recent acquisitions like Moses Brown are helping to stabilize the roster</p>
        
        <p style = "padding-top: 50px;">The Pacers continue to build around young talent like Tyrese Haliburton and Bennedict Mathurin, with Rick Carlisle as head coach. Haliburton led the NBA in assists last season, and the Pacers' addition of Pascal Siakam, a former all-star, leaves fans hopeful for a championship in the coming years.</p>
